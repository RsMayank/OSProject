scheduler  schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and does  consider the completion of the process in this iteration. The scheduler than checks for the number  of process waiting for the processor and allots the processor to the process but interrupting the  processor every 10 unit of time and considers the completion of the processes in this iteration.  The scheduler checks the number of processes waiting in the queue for the processor after the  second iteration and gives the processor to the process which needs more time to complete than  the other processes to go in the terminated state. The inputs for the number of requirements, arrival time and burst time should be provided by the  user.
